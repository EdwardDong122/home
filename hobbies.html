		<h2 class="intro"> For Puzzles, I got into playing the Rubik's cube, or as we call it, "Speed Cubing", as we solve for a fast time.</h2>
		<p class="puzzle">
		I first started 'cubing' February of 2019, when I saw a friend cubing. He
		<br>
		was averaging around 14 seconds per solve, and I thought I needed plenty of time 
		<br>
		to practice in order to reach his level. During that month, I needed to use a 
		<br>
		cheat sheet to solve, and it still took me 3 months. But very quickly, I started
		<br>
		improving, and after a year, I got my all time highest, to this day. I got
		<br>
		a single solve time of 6.0, which really surprised my friends. I would say that
		<br>
		1 year is a pretty small amount of time to drop my personal best by 30 times.
		<br>
		<br>
		<span class="caption">Here is a table showing my how my average and personal best gradually became better up to May.</span>

		<!--Talk about other hobby-->
		<h2 class="intro">For board games, I recently got into chess, during the pandemic.</h2>
		<p class="chess">
		I created my account on Chess.com a few years ago, I took a few lessons, but at the time,
		<br>
		I wasn't very interested and didn't take much information in. I got back into chess 
		<br>
		in grade 8 when we re-learned in class, and we had a competition. I didn't perform the 
		<br>
		best, but this was how I started getting better. I currently play online, not
		<br>
		many over the board games, but Chess.com rating is very similar to competition ratings.
		<br>
		I will be listing my ratings on a table. In terms of Blitz and Bullet, these are time controls
		<br>
		that give you a certain amount of time to play your moves. There may be increment, but I usually
		<br>
		don't play with increment. Blitz time control means 3 minutes to 10 minutes for you, and bullet
		<br>
		can range from 30 seconds to less than 3 minutes. There is also a rating for chess puzzles,
		<br>
		where you try and solve chess problems, in which you try and get the best position possible,
		<br>
		whether it is checkmating the opponent or winning material.
