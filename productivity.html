		<h1 class="title">About Abacus</h1>
		<!--Talk about productivity and extracurriculars-->
		<h2 class="intro">Hello! In this page, I will talk about how I started abacus and how I pursued further into it.</h2>
		<p class="abacus">
			When I was in grade 1, my mom started making me go to abacus. Abacus is a 
			<br>
			plastic or wooden mathematical tool developed by Europeans and Asians.
			<br>
			I took the lessons for a few years, but I hadn't developed an interest for math yet,
			<br>
			so I didn't really have an interest in abacus as well. In grade 3, I quit. 
			<br>
			In grade 5 though, I started having a passion for math, so I asked my mom to 
			<br>
			apply for the lessons again. I participated in a local competition every year, 
			<br>
			but my first global competition was on December 2018, when I was grade 7.
			<br>
			I have never explored southeast Asia, and this was a great experience for me.
			<br>
			The competition was in Malaysia, but my mom and I had time for exploring the 
			<br>
			capital city, Kuala Lumpur. My 2nd competition was also in southeast Asia, 
			<br>
			Thailand. The competition was in a small city, but we stayed in the capital city,
			<br>
			Bangkok, for a while. Abacus helped my brain with memorization, and 
			<br>
			I am grateful for the experiences I gained from taking
			<br>
			abacus and striving for my passions. 
		</p>
		<h2 class="intro"> For Piano, I will be talking about how I started piano.</h2>
		<p class="piano">
			When I was around 4 years old, I started playing piano, because my mom
			<br>
			loved listening to the piano, she wanted to play for her when I grew up.
			<br>
			I am currently almost finished level 10. Although this may seem very low a 
			<br>
			level for how long I've been playing for, in my opinion 10 years would be right 
			<br>
			for 10 levels, since taking your time to finish the whole repetoire, in my opinion,
			<br>
			gives the most value, as experience is worth the most, not levels. Besides,
			<br>
			I have gotten a skill along the way, which I might not have gotten if I 
			<br>
			didn't spend as much time on piano, which is perfect pitch. This helps me 
			<br>
			a lot when memorizing and sight-reading music.
